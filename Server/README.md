# Server

This directory includes the server code. The server runs on Rust using Actix v4 and a Postgres db.

## Running

To run the server you need to specify some environment variables:
- `PG.PASSWORD`: Postgres database password for `postgres` user
- `PG.HOST`: Postgres server address
- `PG.DBNAME`: Postgres server database to use
- `API_KEY`: Key to allow access to the API

These should be declared in the `.env` file in the project root.

Run with `cargo run --release`

### Debug mode

The server is considered unsafe when run in debug mode. When in debug mode the server does not require an API key for use with the API and building will not fail when the API key is not specified.

## Log file

The server will generate a log file. The path for this is specified in [`src/main.rs`](src/main.rs). Each line of the log file has the following format

```
[datetime] REQUEST client method path
[datetime] RESPONSE client method path response
[datetime] DB db_log
```

- `datetime` is the date-time as defined by RFC 3339/ISO 8601 (`2023-02-01T15:34:12.351877+00:00`)
- `client` is the client address (`IP:port`)
- `method` is the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
- `path` is the request path (`api/submit` etc.)
- `response` is the returned response code

An example line might look like the following

```
[2023-02-01T15:34:12.351877+00:00] 127.0.0.1:8080 POST /api/submit 200 3
```
