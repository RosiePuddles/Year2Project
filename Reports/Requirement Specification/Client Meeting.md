# Meeting with client
## Core requirements 
* code must be clean, documented and preferably bug free. Prioritze that criterea over more assets, more environments, etc.
* the code should be written in a modular way
* the VR meditation should be personalized, meaning it adapts to data readings from sensors. Customization is a nice touch, but not the main focus of this project
* Sensors: heart rate monitor, EEG?, eye tracking. We also have Â£100 to spend on sensors.
* adapt to users experience level: beginner, advanced, master etc.
* Its should be actual VR, not justa screen
## Suggestions
* implement gamification?
* add non-live feedback?
* software emphasis?
