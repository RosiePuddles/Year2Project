	abstract = {Many studies have shown that slow breathing training is beneﬁcial for human health. However, several factors might discourage beginners from continuing their training. For example, a long training period is generally required for beneﬁt realization, and there is no real-time feedback to trainees to adjust their breathing control strategy. To raise the user’s interest in breathing exercise training, a virtual reality system with multimodal biofeedback is proposed in this work. In our system, a realistic human model of the trainee is provided in virtual reality ({VR}). At the same time, abdominal movements are sensed, and the breathing rate can be visualized. Being aware of the breathing rate, the trainee can regulate his or her breathing to achieve a slower breathing rate. An additional source of tactile feedback is combined with visual feedback to provide a more immersive experience for the trainees. Finally, the user’s satisfaction with the proposed system is reported through questionnaires. Most of the users ﬁnd it enjoyable to use such a system for mediation training.},

	abstract = {Stories of g-tummo meditators mysteriously able to dry wet sheets wrapped around their naked bodies during a frigid Himalayan ceremony have intrigued scholars and laypersons alike for a century. Study 1 was conducted in remote monasteries of eastern Tibet with expert meditators performing g-tummo practices while their axillary temperature and electroencephalographic ({EEG}) activity were measured. Study 2 was conducted with Western participants (a non-meditator control group) instructed to use the somatic component of the g-tummo practice (vase breathing) without utilization of meditative visualization. Reliable increases in axillary temperature from normal to slight or moderate fever zone (up to 38.3uC) were observed among meditators only during the Forceful Breath type of g-tummo meditation accompanied by increases in alpha, beta, and gamma power. The magnitude of the temperature increases significantly correlated with the increases in alpha power during Forceful Breath meditation. The findings indicate that there are two factors affecting temperature increase. The first is the somatic component which causes thermogenesis, while the second is the neurocognitive component (meditative visualization) that aids in sustaining temperature increases for longer periods. Without meditative visualization, both meditators and non-meditators were capable of using the Forceful Breath vase breathing only for a limited time, resulting in limited temperature increases in the range of normal body temperature. Overall, the results suggest that specific aspects of the g-tummo technique might help non-meditators learn how to regulate their body temperature, which has implications for improving health and regulating cognitive performance.},

We present {RelaWorld}: a neuroadaptive virtual reality meditation system that combines virtual reality with neurofeedback to provide a tool that is easy for novices to use yet provides added value even for experienced meditators. Using a head-mounted display, users can levitate in a virtual world by doing meditation exercises. The system measures users’ brain activity in real time via {EEG} and calculates estimates for the level of concentration and relaxation. These values are then mapped into the virtual reality. In a user study of 43 subjects, we were able to show that the {RelaWorld} system elicits deeper relaxation, feeling of presence and a deeper level of meditation when compared to a similar setup without head-mounted display or neurofeedback.},

	abstract = {Gamiﬁcation has been widely employed in the educational domain over the past eight years when the term became a trend. However, the literature states that gamiﬁcation still lacks formal deﬁnitions to support the design of gamiﬁed strategies. This paper aims to create a taxonomy for the game elements, based on gamiﬁcation experts’ opinions. After a brief review from existing work, we extract ﬁrst the game elements from the current state of the art, and then evaluate them via a survey with 19 gamiﬁcation and education experts. The resulting taxonomy taxonomy included the description of 21 game elements and their quantitative and qualitative evaluation by the experts. Overall, the proposed taxonomy was in general well accepted by most of the experts. They also suggested expanding it with the inclusion of Narrative and Storytelling game elements. Thus, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new, conﬁrmed taxonomy to standardise the terminology used to deﬁne the game elements as a mean to design and deploy gamiﬁcation strategies in the educational domain.},

Recent neuroimaging studies have begun to uncover the brain areas and networks that mediate these positive effects. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear, and it is apparent that more methodologically rigorous studies are required if we are to gain a full understanding of the neuronal and molecular bases of the changes in the brain that accompany mindfulness meditation.},

	title = {{ZenVR}: A biofeedback virtual reality experience for assisting meditation},
	abstract = {A virtual reality application utilising biofeedback to assist novice meditators in reaching a deep meditative state, is presented. Using a virtual reality headset, the meditator becomes fully immersed in a virtual forest, with peaceful music and a guided meditation. Biofeedback is based on the user’s brainwaves and is mediated through fog in the virtual forest. Through the biofeedback, the user becomes aware of their own state of mind. The brainwaves are obtained through a brain computer interface device measuring {EEG} signals.
The system is evaluated on 21 subjects, divided in three groups, each with a different condition. Each subject meditated for five minutes while their heart-rate and brain-waves were monitored. Their meditative depth was measured through a questionnaire.
The test shows no significant difference between the three conditions, but indicates that the participants reached a state of relaxation. The proposed system did not assist the user in reaching a deep meditative state, but virtual reality with biofeedback does have potential to be an entertaining, intriguing and novel approach to meditation.},

	abstract = {Meditation, or mindfulness, is widely used to improve mental health. With the emergence of Virtual Reality technology, many studies have provided evidence that meditation with {VR} can bring health benefits. However, to our knowledge, there are no guidelines and comprehensive reviews in the literature on how to conduct such research in virtual reality. In order to understand the role of {VR} technology in meditation and future research opportunities, we conducted a systematic literature review in the {IEEE} and {ACM} databases. Our process yielded 19 eligible papers and we conducted a structured analysis. We understand the state-of-art of meditation type, design consideration and {VR} and technology through these papers and conclude research opportunities and challenges for the future.},
