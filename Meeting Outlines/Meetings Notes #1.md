##Post Meeting Notes: Entry 1
#Things Achieved and Learned and ideas:
* Set up github repo and shared with group. Will be used for all files related to the project and group work which we need for the report
* Reviewed what we need to do this term and the marking criteria
* Sent a email to our end user, alexandra.i.cristea@durham.ac.uk
* Advice from our advisor:
    1. Contact Alexandra or Craig for headset
    2. Treat our end user no differently to like a company
    3. Focus on assigning roles

* Discussed the following:
  1. Trying to remain consistent in terms of style and font. Dividing the work into 6 and then combining the document where one person edits out incosistencies
  2. Changing having multiple environments or "levels"
  3. Changing the environment, i.e colour, based upon biometric readings
  4. The importance of showing statistics, trying to make it enganging, but not to overwhelm or stress out the user.
  5. Optimising the environment based on data, to make the user most relaxed/aid their meditation
      

#Things to Do:
* Prepare for meeting with Alexandra: have a list of questions to ask and an outline of what we want to build
* Experiment around with Unity 
* Review other papers for ideas about our project
